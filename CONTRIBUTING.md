### ‚úÖ 1. [Search this repo first](https://github.com/hirezio/auto-spies/pulls)...

for an open or closed PR that relates to the change you want to introduce.

.

### ‚úÖ 2. **Before you start coding - find / create an issue**

**Make sure there's an issue** describing the problem you're fixing, or documents the design for the feature you'd like to add.
Discussing the design up front helps to ensure that we're ready to accept your work.

.

- Create a new branch locally in your fork's repo

```shell
git checkout -b my-fix-branch master
```

.

### ‚úÖ 4. Make sure you add / modify tests

Run `pnpm test:full` to make sure there aren't any errors

.

### ‚úÖ 5. Commit your changes using commitizen:

Instead of `git commit` use the following command:

```shell
pnpm commit
```

It will then ask you a bunch of questions.

**For "scope" please choose from the following options:**

| Scope name         | Description                                         |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| core               | a change related to `@hirez_io/auto-spies-core`     |
| jasmine-auto-spies | a change related to `jasmine-auto-spies`            |
| jest-auto-spies    | a change related to `jest-auto-spies`               |
| global             | any change that doesn't fall under the above scopes |

This will create a descriptive commit message that follows the
[Angular commit message convention](#commit-message-format).

This is necessary to generate meaningful release notes / CHANGELOG automatically.

.

### ‚úÖ 6. Push your branch to GitHub:

```shell
git push origin my-fix-branch
```

.

### ‚úÖ 7. In GitHub, create a pull request for `hirezio/auto-spies:master`.

Make sure you check the following checkbox "Allow edits from maintainers" -

If you need to update your PR for some reason -

- Make the required updates.

- Re-run the tests to ensure tests are still passing `yarn test:full`

- Rebase your branch and force push to your GitHub repository (this will update your Pull Request):

  ```shell
  git rebase master -i
  git push -f
  ```

.

### ‚úÖ 8. After your pull request is merged - delete your PR branch

After your pull request is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes from the main (upstream) repository:

- Delete the remote branch on GitHub either through the GitHub web UI or your local shell as follows:

  ```shell
  git push origin --delete my-fix-branch
  ```

- Check out the master branch:

  ```shell
  git checkout master -f
  ```

- Delete the local branch:

  ```shell
  git branch -D my-fix-branch
  ```

- Update your master with the latest upstream version:

  ```shell
  git pull --ff upstream master
  ```

.

### ‚úÖ 9. That's it! Thank you for your contribution! üôèüíì
